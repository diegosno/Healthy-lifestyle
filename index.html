        A healthy lifestyle is not just a diet, but a combination of a balanced
        diet, regular physical activity, and good mental health practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making small changes in your daily routine such as taking the stairs
        instead of the elevator or going for a walk during lunch can help
        improve your physical health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prioritizing sleep, staying hydrated, and reducing stress levels can
        have significant benefits for your mental and emotional wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, limiting processed foods, and
        staying within your daily calorie needs can help you maintain a healthy
        weight and reduce your risk of chronic diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        By adopting a healthy lifestyle, you can increase your energy levels,
        boost your mood, and improve your overall quality of life.
